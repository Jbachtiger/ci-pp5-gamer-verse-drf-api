## Introduction
Gamer Verse is a content platform to share news and have social interactions with likeminded individuals about games. Users will be able to find articles relating to the gaming space, along with community events in local cities. This is the backend API database section of the project built to support the ReactJS frontend, and it is powered by Django Rest Framework.

## User Stories

## Database Schema
DrawSQL was used to create a database schema to visualise the types of custom models this project might require. This schema was used as a guide to what needed to be added to each model.

'collections.OrderedDict' object has no attribute 'size' - this error occured when trying to implement validation for image size. The issue was that the function was called def validate instead of def validate_image
